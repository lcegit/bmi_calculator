# BMI Calculator #

> Instructions: Add a function to calculate BMI using the imperial method.
Modify the UI to allow the user to choose between the Metric- and Imperial methods
Add some CSS to the web interface to create a better look and feel of the application.

The challenge was to set up a BMI calculator program that returns given the user's weight and height. Instructions were given on how to set up the base of the program. I added a function to calculate BMI using the imperial method and created the UI layer using JQuery, Javascript, HTML/CSS. The program is tested using Jasmine while running a web server locally.
